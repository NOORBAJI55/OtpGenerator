# OTP Generator

This project implements a simple One-Time Password (OTP) generator in Java. The OTP is generated using random digits and can be customized for different lengths.

## Features

- Generates a random OTP consisting of numeric digits
- Customizable OTP length
- Easy to use and understand Java implementation

## How It Works

The `OtpGen` class contains a method `generateOTP(int len)` that generates a random OTP of the specified length using the `Random` class. The generated OTP is printed to the console when the program is executed.

This project is useful for understanding the basics of random number generation and can be extended for applications requiring OTP functionality.
